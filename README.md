# Isometric-Dnd


An isometric S-rpg (Strategy role playing game) made in Unity, ported from java (with JMonkeyEngine)

One day my mind crossed two ideas: Dungeons and Dragons and Fire Emblem. And now i'm developing this project.
It's in an early stage tho, there's a lot of work to do and it's just me in the project,so major updates will be really slow.

What i aim to achieve:

Fire emblem

And maybe a character creator like in Fire Emblem Awakening
